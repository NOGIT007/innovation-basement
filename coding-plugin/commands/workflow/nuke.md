Generate Chat Nuke summary.

## Summary Generation

Create high-signal summary containing:

### Project Context
- Repository and branch
- Feature/task being worked on
- Current phase

### Progress Summary
- What has been completed
- What is in progress
- What remains

### Key Learnings
- What worked
- What failed (and why)
- Important discoveries

### Critical References
- Key file paths
- Important code snippets
- Relevant documentation

### Next Steps
- Immediate next action
- Remaining plan items

### Copy-Paste Block
```
[Formatted summary ready for new chat]
```

## When to Use
- Context estimated >60% full
- After 3+ failed bug fix attempts
- Conversation feels circular
- Starting fresh would help clarity
