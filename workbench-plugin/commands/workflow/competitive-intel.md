### Step 1: Individual Research (parallel)
For each competitor/option mentioned, use Market Researcher to gather:
- Market positioning and target audience
- Pricing and packaging
- Key features and capabilities
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Recent news and developments

Save each to `/Users/kennetkusk/Documents/Output/{topic}/research/{competitor_name}.md`

### Step 2: Technical Analysis (if relevant)
If the comparison involves technical products, also run Technical Analyst for architecture insights.
Save to `/Users/kennetkusk/Documents/Output/{topic}/research/{competitor_name}_technical.md`

### Step 3: SWOT Analysis
For each competitor, create a SWOT matrix:
- **Strengths**: Internal advantages and capabilities
- **Weaknesses**: Internal limitations and gaps
- **Opportunities**: External factors they could exploit
- **Threats**: External risks and competitive pressures

Include a combined SWOT comparison table in the synthesis.

### Step 4: Synthesis
Create a comprehensive comparison report combining all research:
- Executive summary with recommendation
- Feature comparison table
- Pricing comparison
- SWOT matrices for each competitor
- Combined SWOT comparison
- Final recommendation with rationale

Save to `/Users/kennetkusk/Documents/Output/{topic}/analysis/{topic}_competitive_intel.md`

### Step 5: Final Deliverable (optional)
Ask if user wants PDF or PPTX output.
If yes, use appropriate skill and save to `/Users/kennetkusk/Documents/Output/{topic}/final/`
